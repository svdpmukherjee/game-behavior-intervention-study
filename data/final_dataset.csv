Like in an education setting? Or was it meaning more like what is on prolific and the different things on there? It wasn't clear enough. The game was difficult because the letters didn't move easily, the drag and drop was temperamental and kept not working properly. Why did it require a drag and drop, why not just a click? Would have been significantly easier. There was always 2 letters, usually 'e' that showed up as the word 'and' in the square instead of the letter they were supposed to be and would randomly flash their proper letter then disappear again, but not being able to properly see what the letters were made it more difficult. It was flawed. The list on the side seemed very random. Every word there had an 'x' by it as though ti was wrong, half the words showing there weren't even ones I'd submitted, or ones that could have been made. Where did 'fall' come from? Completely wrong letters, wrong length, etc. Overall just... not well done at all. Frustrating."

I would write a similar message as the one shown. I would maybe include that God is watching, even though there could be irreligious or faithless people.","It was great -- thanks for the opportunity! Time limits always stress me out and I feel under pressure which affects my performance. I usually do better at word games like this. My mouse also caused problems for me, so I had to use my laptops touchpad. I would definitely suggest to make it easier to pick letters. I didn't consider cheating because I strive not to approach life in that way. My moral compass is Islam and I'm grateful for all I've learnt through it. So, that's why when I read the message before beginning the challenge I was confused and thought it was unrelated to the task. Now that I think about it though, people can cheat during this challenge."
