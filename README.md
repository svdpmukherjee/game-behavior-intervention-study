# Game Behavior Intervention Study

This project implements a comprehensive framework for studying the effects of psychological interventions on player behavior in word puzzle solving games. The project consists of three main components:

## Project Structure

game-behavior-intervention-study/
├── game-application/ # The actual game web application
├── message-intervention-framework/ # System for generating anti-cheating messages
└── game-behavior-analytics/ # Data analysis and visualization tools

## Components

### 1. Game Application (`game-application/`)

This component contains a full-stack web application that implements an word puzzle solving game:

- **Frontend**: A React.js application that provides the game interface, survey forms and user interaction tracking
- **Backend**: A FastAPI server that handles user sessions, game data and stores interaction events in MongoDB

The game application is where participants interact with the study, complete anagram puzzles, and receive intervention messages.

### 2. Message Intervention Framework (`message-intervention-framework/`)

This component is responsible for generating and optimizing messages designed to reduce cheating behavior:

- **Generator**: LLaMA 3.3 (70B) LLM creates messages based on 15 psychological concepts taken from 4 behavioral theories (self-determination theory, cognitive dissonance theory, self-efficacy theory and social norms theory)
- **Evaluator**: GPT-4o LLM evaluates the effectiveness of each generated message in targeting specific psychological constructs
- **Optimizer**: Iteratively improves messages through a feedback loop

The intervention messages generated by this framework are used as textual interventions displayed before the game playing to influence player behavior.

### 3. Game Behavior Analytics (`game-behavior-analytics/`)

This component provides tools for processing and analyzing game event data:

- **Data Preprocessing**: Pipelines for extracting and preparing data from MongoDB
- **Analysis**: Scripts for detecting cheating behavior and analyzing the effectiveness of interventions
- **Visualization**: Tools for generating visual representations of player behavior and game events

## Execution Order

For a complete study deployment, the components should be used in this order:

1. **Message Generation**: Run the message intervention framework to generate optimized anti-cheating messages
2. **Database Initialization**: Initialize the database with game configuration and generated messages
3. **Game Deployment**: Deploy the game application for participants to use
4. **Data Analysis**: After data collection, use the analytics tools to process and visualize results

## Getting Started

Each component folder contains its own README with detailed setup and usage instructions.

- See `game-application/README.md` for instructions on setting up and running the game
- See `message-intervention-framework/README.md` for details on message generation and optimization
- See `game-behavior-analytics/README.md` for information on data analysis and visualization

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Node.js 16+
- MongoDB
- See individual component READMEs for specific dependencies
